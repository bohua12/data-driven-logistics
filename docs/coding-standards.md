# Coding Standards Document

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines the coding standards and conventions for the [Project Name] development team. The goal is to ensure that our codebase is consistent, readable, and maintainable, facilitating collaboration and quality across the project lifecycle.

### Scope
These standards apply to all software development activities for [Project Name], including but not limited to, code written in Python, JavaScript, and any associated HTML and CSS. They cover naming conventions, formatting and style, commenting, version control practices, error handling, and security considerations.

## Naming Conventions

### Variables
- Use camelCase for variable names and make them descriptive of their purpose.
- Boolean variables should be prefixed with `is`, `has`, or `can`.

```
// Good
let customerCount = 5;
let isUserLoggedIn = false;

// Bad
let count = 5;
let logged_in = false;
```

### Functions and Methods
- Use camelCase for function names. Begin with a verb indicating the function's action.

```
# Good
def calculateTotalPrice():
    pass

def fetchUserData():
    pass

# Bad
def calc_price():
    pass

def getdata():
    pass
```

### Classes
- Use PascalCase for class names. Names should be nouns or noun phrases that clearly indicate the purpose of the class.

```
# Good
class ShoppingCart:
    pass

class UserProfile:
    pass

# Bad
class shopping_cart:
    pass

class userprofile:
    pass
```

### Constants
- Use uppercase with underscores to separate words.

```
// Good
const MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3;
const DEFAULT_USER_ROLE = 'guest';

// Bad
const maxRetries = 3;
const UserRole = 'guest';
```

### Files and Directories
- Use PascalCase for files that are named after classes they contain, such as components in React (e.g., UserProfile.js) or class-based files in other languages (e.g., DatabaseConnection.py).
- Use kebab-case for other types of files and directories, especially when they do not directly correspond to a class or when the framework or language does not have a preference for PascalCase.
- Group files into directories that represent their module or functionality.

```
// Good Examples
React Component: UserProfile.jsx
Angular Service: AuthService.ts
C# Class File: UserRepository.cs

// For non-class files or when not dictated by language/framework conventions
Stylesheet: user-profile.css
Utility Script: format-date.js
```

## Formatting and Style

### Indentation
- Use spaces instead of tabs, with 4 spaces per indentation level for Python and 2 spaces for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


### Braces
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement for JavaScript.
- Use a new line for opening braces in Python blocks (as per the language's syntax).

### Line Length
- Limit lines to 80 characters where possible to enhance readability.

### Whitespace
- Use whitespace around operators and after commas to improve readability.

```
// Good
if (user.isLoggedIn) {
    console.log('User is logged in.');
    fetchUserData();
} else {
    console.log('User is not logged in.');
}

// Bad - inconsistent spacing and indentation
if(user.isLoggedIn){
console.log('User is logged in.');
 fetchUserData();
}else{
console.log('User is not logged in.');
}
```

## Commenting and Documentation

### Inline Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly to explain "why" behind a non-obvious piece of logic.

### Block Comments
- Use block comments above functions, classes, and complex logic blocks, describing the purpose and any important details.

### Documentation
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript documentation.
- Use docstrings for Python, following the PEP 257 conventions.

```
# Good
def calculateInterest(rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the interest over a given period.

    Args:
        rate (float): The interest rate per annum.
        years (int): The number of years.

    Returns:
        float: The total interest.
    """
    return principal * rate * years  # Return the total interest

# Bad - comments are vague or unnecessary
def calcInterest(r, y):
    # Function to calculate interest
    return p * r * y  # Calculate interest
```

## Language-Specific Practices

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 for all Python code.
- Use list comprehensions for simple loops that generate lists.

### JavaScript
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions where possible.

## Error Handling

### Exceptions
- Use try-catch blocks for error handling in JavaScript, and try-except in Python.
- Create custom exception classes for errors specific to the application's domain.

```
// Good
try {
    const data = JSON.parse(response);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to parse response:', error);
}

// Bad - ignoring errors
try {
    const data = JSON.parse(response);
} catch (error) {
    // Should handle or log the error
}
```

### Logging
- Use `console.log` judiciously in JavaScript; prefer logging libraries for more significant applications.
- Use Python's logging module for application logs, configuring different log levels appropriately.

## Version Control

### Branching Model
- Follow Git Flow, with separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

### Commit Messages
- Write concise, descriptive commit messages in the imperative mood.

```
// Good
Fix: Correct typo in user authentication flow

// Bad
fixed stuff
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new code, aiming for a high coverage percentage.
- Name test functions descriptively, starting with `test_`.

### Code Coverage
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage through unit tests.

## Security

### Coding Against Vulnerabilities
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use parameterized queries for database access.

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never hard-code sensitive information in the codebase.
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive data.

## Review Process

### Code Review Guidelines
- Require code reviews for **all** merges into the `main` or `develop` branches.
- Reviewers should focus on code quality, security, and adherence to project standards.

## Enforcement

### Tools and Automation
- Use ESLint for JavaScript and Pylint for Python to enforce coding standards.
- Integrate these tools with the CI/CD pipeline to automate compliance checks.
