# Backend Models

This folder contains the classes for the relevant entities for 
the project, such as businesses and users. Each class 
contains functionality specific to that class, for instance
the `User` class contains the `hashPassword` method because
only the User entity has passwords and needs to deal with
authorization and authentication.

As the project progresses, more models will be added into
this folder.
