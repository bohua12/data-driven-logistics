# Running backend tests

To run tests, make sure you've installed all the 
dev dependencies for the project. Then,

```shell
npm test
```

The following command will generate a new 
directory with coverage reports you can view in 
a browser:

```shell
npm test:coverage
```

You can customize Jest behavior by modifying the `jest.config.js` file.
