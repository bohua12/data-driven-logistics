# Contributing to Our Project

To ensure our project's maintainability, scalability, and code quality, we follow a structured workflow for addressing issues and adding new features. Below is a step-by-step guide every team member should follow:

1. **Branch Creation**: 
    - For any new task, create a branch off the main branch using a descriptive naming convention, such as <your_name>/<issue_description>.     
    - This helps in identifying who is working on what and what the branch is intended to address.

2. **Test-First Approach**: 
    - Before diving into the development code, write tests that outline the expected behavior of the feature or fix you're working on. 
    - This test-first approach ensures that we're building features that meet our predefined criteria and helps catch any potential issues early.

3. **Development Work**: 
    - With your tests in place, proceed with the development work.
    - Having tests written beforehand provides a clear goal and helps in driving the development process.

4. **Passing Tests**: 
    - Ensure that your code passes all the tests you've written. 
    - If your work introduces new functionality, it must be covered by tests, and all existing tests must pass to confirm that no regression occurs.

5. **Visual Verification**: 
    - Besides automated tests, manually build and run the app to perform a visual check. 
    - This step is crucial for catching any UI/UX issues that automated tests might miss. Ensure the app behaves as expected through user interaction.

6. **Merge Request (MR) Creation**: 
    - Once you're confident in your code, create a merge request and notify the group. 
    - Your MR should include a concise yet comprehensive description of the changes, why they were made, and any specific areas or files that require particular attention during review.

7. **Review and Approval**: 
    - Merge requests require at least one approval from a peer before merging into the main branch. 
    - The reviewer should be someone familiar with the task at hand and the technology stack used.
    - This ensures a second set of eyes evaluates the code for quality, logic, and adherence to project standards.

8. **(In Future) Continuous Integration (CI) Checks**: 
    - Ensure that your MR passes all continuous integration checks if your project uses CI tools. 
    - This includes automated builds, tests, and code quality checks.

9. **Conflict Resolution**: 
    - Before finalizing the merge, make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch and resolve any conflicts that arise. 
    - This step is essential for maintaining a clean, linear project history.

10. **Documentation**: 
    - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made. 
    - Good documentation supports the team's understanding and makes onboarding new members more efficient.


## Final Notes

- Stay in constant communication with the team, especially regarding changes that may affect others' work.
- Regularly pull updates from `main` to your branch to minimize merge conflicts.
- Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
