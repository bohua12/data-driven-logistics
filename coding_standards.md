# Coding Standards Document

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines the coding standards and conventions for the [Project Name] development team. The goal is to ensure that our codebase is consistent, readable, and maintainable, facilitating collaboration and quality across the project lifecycle.

### Scope
These standards apply to all software development activities for [Project Name], including but not limited to, code written in Python, JavaScript, and any associated HTML and CSS. They cover naming conventions, formatting and style, commenting, version control practices, error handling, and security considerations.

## Naming Conventions

### Variables
- Use camelCase for variable names and make them descriptive of their purpose.
- Boolean variables should be prefixed with `is`, `has`, or `can`.

### Functions and Methods
- Use camelCase for function names. Begin with a verb indicating the function's action (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `fetchUserData`).

### Classes
- Use PascalCase for class names. Names should be nouns or noun phrases that clearly indicate the purpose of the class.

### Constants
- Use uppercase with underscores to separate words (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`).

### Files and Directories
- Use kebab-case for directories and files (e.g., `user-profile.js`).
- Group files into directories that represent their module or functionality.

## Formatting and Style

### Indentation
- Use spaces instead of tabs, with 4 spaces per indentation level for Python and 2 spaces for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Braces
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement for JavaScript.
- Use a new line for opening braces in Python blocks (as per the language's syntax).

### Line Length
- Limit lines to 80 characters where possible to enhance readability.

### Whitespace
- Use whitespace around operators and after commas to improve readability.

## Commenting and Documentation

### Inline Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly to explain "why" behind a non-obvious piece of logic.

### Block Comments
- Use block comments above functions, classes, and complex logic blocks, describing the purpose and any important details.

### Documentation
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript documentation.
- Use docstrings for Python, following the PEP 257 conventions.

## Language-Specific Practices

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 for all Python code.
- Use list comprehensions for simple loops that generate lists.

### JavaScript
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions where possible.

## Error Handling

### Exceptions
- Use try-catch blocks for error handling in JavaScript, and try-except in Python.
- Create custom exception classes for errors specific to the application's domain.

### Logging
- Use `console.log` judiciously in JavaScript; prefer logging libraries for more significant applications.
- Use Python's logging module for application logs, configuring different log levels appropriately.

## Version Control

### Branching Model
- Follow Git Flow, with separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

### Commit Messages
- Write concise, descriptive commit messages in the imperative mood.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new code, aiming for a high coverage percentage.
- Name test functions descriptively, starting with `test_`.

### Code Coverage
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage through unit tests.

## Security

### Coding Against Vulnerabilities
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use parameterized queries for database access.

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never hard-code sensitive information in the codebase.
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive data.

## Review Process

### Code Review Guidelines
- Require code reviews for all merges into the `main` or `develop` branches.
- Reviewers should focus on code quality, security, and adherence to project standards.

## Enforcement

### Tools and Automation
- Use ESLint for JavaScript and Pylint for Python to enforce coding standards.
- Integrate these tools with the CI/CD pipeline to automate compliance checks.
